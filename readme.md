## Automated tests for an ecommerce demo site

This is a demo Ruby project showing the use of RSpec (a Ruby test framework)  and Capybara (a Selenium wrapper) to test the major features of a third-party demo ecommerce site at http://automationpractice.com/

I have used the FactoryBot gem to create factories and the Faker gem to generate random data.

To run this project you will need
* Ruby 2.1.2 or greater
* bundler

To install bundler
```gem install bundler```

To install the gems
```bundle install```

To run the tests:
```bundle exec rspec```
